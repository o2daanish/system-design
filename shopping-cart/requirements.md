# Functional Requirements
## 1. User Authentication
- Registration: Users can create an account by providing necessary details (e.g., email, password).
- Login: Users can log in using their credentials, with session management via JWT.
- Password Management: Users can reset or change their passwords.

## 2. Cart Management
- Create Cart: Users can create a new shopping cart.
- Add Items to Cart: Users can add multiple items to the cart in a single operation.
- Update Item Quantity: Users can modify the quantity of items already in the cart.
- Remove Items from Cart: Users can remove specific items from the cart.
- Clear Cart: Users can empty the cart completely.
- View Cart: Users can retrieve and view the current state of the cart.

## 3. Item Management
- Fetch Item Details: Users can retrieve information about items (e.g., name, price, availability).
- Check Stock Availability: Before adding items, the system checks for available stock.

## 4. Sharing Cart
- Share Cart: Users can share their cart with specified user IDs.
- View Shared Users: Users can see who the cart is shared with and their permissions (view/edit).

## 5. Real-Time Synchronization
- Real-Time Updates: All users sharing the cart should see updates (additions/removals) in real-time.
- Notifications: Users receive notifications for any changes made to shared cart items.

## 6. Error Handling
- Response Codes: The system should provide appropriate HTTP status codes for success and errors.
- Error Messages: Users receive meaningful error messages for invalid requests (e.g., unauthorized access, item not found).

## 7. Logging and Auditing
- Action Logging: Track user actions related to cart modifications (add, update, delete).
- Audit Trail: Maintain a history of changes made to the cart, including timestamps and user IDs.

# Non-Functional Requirements

## 1. Performance
- Response Time: Cart operations (add, update, remove) should be processed within 500 milliseconds.
- Concurrent Users: The system should support at least 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.

## 2. Scalability
- Horizontal Scalability: The architecture must support scaling out by adding more service instances as load increases.
- Data Scalability: The database (Cassandra) should handle large volumes of data and high read/write throughput.

## 3. Availability
- Uptime: The system should maintain 99.9% uptime, with minimal downtime for maintenance.
- Redundancy: Implement redundancy in critical components to ensure high availability.

## 4. Fault Tolerance
- Redundancy: Deploy multiple instances of each microservice to handle failures without impacting the user experience.
- Graceful Degradation: Ensure that the system can continue to operate in a limited capacity if certain services fail (e.g., using cached data).
- Error Recovery: Implement mechanisms for automatic recovery from failures (e.g., retry logic, circuit breakers).
- Data Backup: Regularly back up data to ensure recovery in case of catastrophic failures.

## 5 Security
- Data Encryption: All data transmissions must be encrypted using HTTPS.
- User Data Protection: Sensitive user data must be securely stored and comply with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR).

## 6. Usability
- User Interface: The interface should be intuitive, allowing users to easily navigate and manage their carts.
- User Feedback: Provide clear feedback for actions performed (e.g., "Item added to cart").

## 7. Maintainability
- Code Structure: The code should be modular and adhere to best practices for easier maintenance and updates.
- Documentation: Comprehensive documentation should be provided for APIs and system architecture.

## 8. Compatibility
- Cross-Platform: The system should work seamlessly across major browsers and mobile devices.
- Integration: Ensure compatibility with existing payment and order services if applicable.

## 9. Data Consistency
- Consistency Model: Ensure that cart data remains consistent across all users in real-time.
- Eventual Consistency: Implement eventual consistency where necessary, especially for asynchronous operations.
